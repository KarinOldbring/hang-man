## **Aim of the site**

The site is for users who want to play a fun game of Hangman. There are a great number of random words, 2466 to be precise, so the game can be quite tricky even without any difficulty levels present. The player has 6 guesses before the game is over and the number of turns left will be displayed using the classic hangman images (a man being hung).

Once the player has entered their name, they are asked if they want to play. If they choose yes (Y) the game starts, if they choose no (N) then they are being thanked for their participation and the game ends. If anything else is entered they get an invalid option message.
